    <h2>These pancakes are perfect for a cozy breakfast.</h2>
    <p>Recipe Tip: If the batter seems too thin, let it rest for 5 minutes. If still too thin, whisk in 1 to 2 tablespoons additional flour.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground dried ginger or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon or to taste</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup molasses</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, and cinnamon in a bowl; set aside. Beat egg, vanilla, and molasses in a separate mixing bowl until smooth. Whisk in water until completely incorporated. Stir flour mixture into molasses mixture until just combined (a few lumps are okay).</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
